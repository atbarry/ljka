# LJKA my first AI project

This is my first dive into AI and machine learning, I tried creating a simple AI that learns to find a target on the screen. I created a neural network from scratch, and tried training it based on the survival of the fittest principle I guess.

## Examples

This is a real example of how the AI learns over time. Progress is slow overall, but every once in a while there is a sudden jump in performance. This is due to a random mutation that was very successful. It was able to get to around 90% success over 250 generations (Note: around 280 on the chart is not an increase in performance, but because all AI mutations were removed)

## Cool Looking Results

Note: This the program found by complete chance on the first generation, I didn't even know it was possible to get this result.
